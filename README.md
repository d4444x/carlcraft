###Introduction

The purpose of this mod is to make Minecraft survival mode more interesting, and to increase the amount of play-time between starting out and reaching endgame gear. This mod has a bigger and more realistic tech tree than vanilla, and the tech tree is pretty flexible. There’s almost always more than one way to do things at every stage of the game. This mod requires and rewards gathering stacks and stacks of resources, and pretty much every resource you can find is useful.

This somewhat lengthy document has pretty much all the information about everything in the mod. If you’re like me, you’ll probably memorize it before starting. If you’re a normal human, you can definitely start playing and just look things up as you go and pick a random section to read when you don’t know what to do next.

1. Early Game

•	No wood or stone tools

•	Sticks, rocks, flint, and copper nuggets can be found on the ground

•	4 rocks -> 1 cobblestone

•	Gold nuggets and meteorites(smelt these!) can rarely be found on the ground

•	Flint Knife (basic weapon): 1 stick + 1 flint

•	Stone Club (basic weapon): vanilla stone shovel recipe

•	Flint Hatchet (basic axe): 2 sticks + 1 flint: (S is stick, F is flint, doesn’t require crafting table)

S F

S

•	Any raw meat -> animal fat

•	Stick + Animal Fat -> torches (vanilla torch recipe still works, but you can’t mine coal until you get a copper pickaxe)

•	Cows & Horses no longer drop leather. All animals except chickens now drop hides, which can be turned into leather using a Vat. Cows and Horses drop the most hide.

•	Eggs can be cooked!

•	Wooden buckets! Craft with 3 planks (like a vanilla bucket) and one stick in the top middle slot. The stick makes a convenient handle. Being wooden, they can’t exactly pick up lava.

•	New Dirt ores: Malachite (green, copper ore), Pyrite (yellow, iron ore), Fossils (bones), and Peat (usable as fuel, smelts 3 items)

•	Firestarters: craft with one pyrite, and one flint. They’re like flint and steel, except they suck and have only a 50% chance to actually light a fire.

•	Stone Shattering: if you set a fire next to stone or cobblestone, and then dump a bucket of water directly on the fire, the stone will crack! Stone -> cobblestone -> drops rocks. This will also evaporate the water, unfortunately.

•	Goal #1 is to get enough cobblestone to make a furnace (remember: rocks craft into cobble)

•	Goal #2 is to get enough copper to make a copper pickaxe (find it? Smelt malachite?)

•	See the flux section before you smelt your ores! (using flux = get more metal per ore)

2. Vats

•	New item processing block

•	Crafting recipe: (S = stick, P = wood planks)

SPS

P  P

SPS

•	Place a bucket of liquid in the input slot to fill the vat with liquid. A vat of liquid can process certain items. 

•	A whole stack of items is processed at once, and generally consumes the liquid

•	Water + Ashes = Potash (see furnace and flux sections)

•	Water + Log = Vat of tannin

•	Tannin + Hides = Leather

3. Furnace

•	Two new slots: Flux and Ash slots

•	Flux slot (top left): put flux here to improve yields from ore. See the Flux section.

•	Ash slot (bottom left): Ashes appear here when a piece of fuel fully burns up

•	Temperature indicator (on right): furnace has four possible temperatures (off, normal, hot, and very hot)

•	Using a bellows or burning coke will make the furnace hot (2x smelting speed, can smelt bronze)

•	Using bellows AND burning coke at the same time will make the furnace very hot (4x smelting speed, can smelt bronze and steel)

4. Ores, metals, and alloys

•	Smelting ores yields nuggets. It now takes more than 1 ore block to make 1 ingot.

•	9 nuggets can be crafted into 1 ingot

•	7 or 8 of a base metal nugget (copper/iron) plus 1 or 2 alloy metal nuggets can make Bronze and Steel alloys. Combine the nuggets in a crafting table to get an unsmelted alloy, then smelt it in the furnace. Smelting bronze requires coke fuel OR bellows, smelting steel requires both.

•	Generally speaking, alloys with 2 alloying nuggets are stronger than those with 1 alloying nugget. (7 copper + 2 tin  >  8 copper + 1 tin)

•	8 copper + 1 tin is called “low-tin alloy” or just “tin alloy”. 7 copper + 2 tin is called “high-tin alloy”. 7 copper + 1 tin + 1 zinc is called “tin/zinc alloy” or “low-tin and low-zinc alloy”

•	Alloy metal ores (zinc, tin, nickel, cobalt, titanium) only spawn in some chunks (~10% chance per chunk, separate chance for each one)

•	Alloy metals are rare, but once you find some, there is most likely more of it in the same chunk!

•	ORE MINING REQUIREMENTS (note that iron sucks!):

o	Nickel, gold, and lead ore: requires a pickaxe made of bronze or steel

o	Cobalt and titanium ore: requires a pickaxe made of steel 

5. Basic ores and metals

•	Copper and iron (copper is lowest tier metal, iron is 2nd lowest tier metal)

•	malachite -> 1 copper nugget

•	copper ore -> 3 copper nuggets

•	pyrite -> 1 iron nugget

•	iron ore -> 3 iron nuggets

•	lead ore -> 3 lead nuggets

•	All other ores -> 1 nugget of its type

6. Mid-tier metal (Bronze and Brass)

•	Bronze and brass alloys can be made using copper + tin or zinc, respectively (can be mixed: 1 tin, 1 zinc). I generally refer to both bronze and brass as “Bronze” elsewhere in this document

o	Tin adds damage/mining speed, and a bit of durability

o	Zinc adds durability, and a bit of damage/mining speed

•	As a rule of thumb, even the worst copper alloy is still better than iron

•	Note that you must have either bellows or coke as fuel to smelt bronze, and that bronze still takes 10 seconds despite the 2x furnace speed.

•	Alloy description examples for tools made of bronze:

o	“zinc alloy” means one zinc nugget was used for each ingot

o	“high-zinc alloy” means two zinc nuggets were used for each ingot

o	“tin/zinc alloy” means one tin nugget and one zinc nugget was used for each ingot

7. High-tier metal (Steel)

•	Steel alloys are made using iron as a base metal, plus 1 or 2 of any of the following (including 1 of one, and 1 of another): carbon(coke), nickel, cobalt, titanium

o	Carbon (coke) adds a lot of damage/mining speed but reduces durability

o	Nickel adds some damage and some durability

o	Cobalt adds an enormous amount of durability, and a bit of damage

o	Titanium adds an enormous amount of damage/mining speed, and a bit of durability

•	Note that you must have BOTH bellows AND coke as fuel to smelt steel, and that steel still takes 10 seconds to smelt despite the 4x furnace speed.

8. Rose Gold

•	8 gold nuggets + 1 copper nugget -> unsmelted rose gold

•	Rose Gold can mine ores like a bronze pickaxe, but doesn’t require a hot furnace to smelt. 

•	It’s also pink, in case you’re into that sort of thing.

9. Flint and Steel (and firestarters)

•	Flint and Steel now requires a High-Carbon Steel ingot to craft, instead of an iron ingot.

•	Flint and Steel has much higher durability than in Vanilla.

•	A crappy version, called a firestarter, can be made with Flint and Pyrite (the yellow ore found in dirt)

•	Firestarters have low durability and only a 50% chance of successfully starting a fire. You will probably need at least one firestarter early in the game to make charcoal. Keep in mind that it’s statistically possible for it to take a dozen tries to start a fire with a firestarter.

10. Steel Buckets (and wood buckets)

•	Wood buckets are crafted with 3 planks (similar to a vanilla bucket) plus a stick on top (handles are nice to have on buckets).

•	However, being made of wood, they can’t exactly pick up lava.

•	Steel buckets are crafted like vanilla buckets, except out of any heat-resistant steel alloy (any alloy that contains
cobalt), and they can pick up lava. All steel buckets are the same, regardless of which cobalt alloy they’re made of. All 3 ingots must be the SAME alloy though.

•	Vanilla buckets (iron) don’t exist.

11. Charcoal and Coke (and wood piles)

•	Charcoal is no longer made by smelting log blocks.

•	Charcoal is important as a flux, and as a stepping stone towards making Coke.

•	Procedure for making charcoal:

o	Craft a wood pile block (9 sticks in crafting table) and place it in the world.

o	Surround the wood pile on all sides but one with solid, preferably nonflammable blocks.

o	Set the final side on fire. This will ignite the wood pile block (the block changes to an ignited state). Any source of fire will do.

o	Quickly replace the fire with another solid block, so that the ignited wood pile is completely surrounded.

o	Wait for the wood to char. This will take about two minutes. When the wood is charred, the fire sounds will stop.

o	Dig out the charred wood pile. 1 wood pile -> 1 charcoal.

•	Coke is made the same way as charcoal, except using a Charcoal or Coal block instead of the wood pile block. Coke must also be mined with a pickaxe. 1 Coal/Charcoal block -> 1 Coke.

•	Coke can be used as an "alloy nugget" when making steel.

•	Coke as fuel burns hot, increasing furnace temperature and smelting speed.

•	More information about ignited wood piles, coal blocks, and charcoal blocks:

o	Ignited blocks will constantly try to start fires in the 6 block locations immediately adjacent to themselves (hence surrounding them in solid blocks).

o	Ignited blocks CAN be destroyed by adjacent fire blocks, meaning they will eventually destroy themselves if not surrounded in other blocks.

o	Ignited blocks will also ignite other wood piles/coal blocks/charcoal blocks which are adjacent to them. Therefore, you can make big charcoal pits! 

o	If you put a bunch of unignited blocks together, you only have to start a fire once, and it will spread from block to block

12. Bellows

•	Bellows are crafted as follows: (P = wood planks, L = leather, I = iron ingot)

   PP
   
 I LL
 
   PP
   
•	right clicking a placed bellows while it's next to a furnace will do the following:

o	increase furnace temperature for 2 (two) seconds

o	put the bellows on cooldown for 3 (three) seconds

•	This means that to keep a furnace heated continuously using bellows, you MUST have at least two bellows (a single bellows can still speed up normal smelting though). 

o	If you’re depending on the bellows heat for smelting an alloy, the heat from bellows must be continuous, or the smelting will keep restarting and never finish!

•	Using a bellows on a furnace which is already bellows-heated will reset the timer to 2 seconds, but will not make the furnace any hotter.

•	Bellows blocks face a specific direction: the furnace must be in the right place to be affected (bellows will snap to a nearby furnace when placed)

•	Bellows can also be activated with redstone, if you’re too smart/lazy to do it by hand.

o	With proper wiring, a circuit can be made which makes two bellows continuously and automatically heat a furnace. For reference: 1 second = 20 minecraft ticks. Repeater delay = 2/4/6/8 minecraft ticks, depending on the setting. Redstone torches have 1 tick delay. Redstone wire has no delay.

13. Flux

•	Flux is used to increase how many nuggets you get from smelting ore. One flux is consumed per smelting operation

•	There are 3 tiers of flux:

•	Basic Fluxes (Potash, Borax, and Charcoal)

o	Basic fluxes add +1 nugget when smelting copper, iron, and lead

•	Mixed Flux (crafted, potash + borax + charcoal)

o	Mixed flux adds +2 nuggets when smelting copper, iron, and lead

o	Mixed flux adds +1 nugget when smelting tin, zinc, and gold

•	Nether Flux (crafted, Mixed Flux + nether wart)

o	Nether flux adds +3 nuggets when smelting copper, iron, and lead

o	Nether flux adds +2 nuggets when smelting tin, zinc, and gold

o	Nether flux adds +1 nugget when smelting nickel, cobalt, and titanium

14. Other ores

•	Borax: Pinkish ore, found in large veins, commonly near the surface but sometimes deep underground as well. Used as basic flux.

•	Saltpeter: Black/white speckled ore. Saltpeter + charcoal + sulfur = gunpowder

•	Sulfur: found on the ground in the nether

•	A new kind of lapis ore now spawns in sandstone

•	Vanilla Lapis ore does not spawn

•	Diamond ore does not spawn
 
15. Bandages

•	Crafted as follows: (P = paper, W = wool)
   P
PWP

•	Use to regenerate health!

•	Yeah I know it sounds like you’re eating the bandage. I’m working on it. At least I was able to remove the burp.

16. Enchanting

•	Right now, there’s no way to get an enchanting table, because diamond ore doesn’t exist. In most cases, the best steel armors/weapons are better than enchanted diamond ones anyway.

17. Armor

•	As a general rule, alloys which have high damage/tool speed also have high armor points.

•	Obviously, alloys with high tool durability also have high armor durability.

•	Alloy Armors come with enchantments, based on alloy materials

o	Zinc: Blast Protection (I for low-zinc alloys, II for high-zinc alloy)

o	Tin: Projectile Protection (I for low-tin alloys, II for high-tin alloy)

o	Carbon(coke): nothing

o	Nickel: Blast Protection (II for low-nickel alloys, IV for high-nickel alloy)

o	Cobalt: Fire Protection (II for low-cobalt alloys, IV for high-cobalt alloy)

o	Titanium: Protection (II for low-titanium alloys, IV for high-titanium alloy)

•	There are five alloys which let you reach maximum armor. These are the four titanium+anything alloys, and the high-carbon alloy

•	Note that if you equip a full set of high-cobalt armor (fire protection IV on each piece) you will vastly exceed the maximum usable amount of fire protection. The maximum amount is slightly more than two pieces of armor each having fire protection IV. (example: IV, IV, II, 0)

18. Firearms

•	Basic firearms can be made out of tin/zinc bronze alloy

•	Better firearms can be made out of nickel/carbon, nickel/cobalt, and nickel/titanium steel

•	Bronze firearms (pistol/musket) fire lead nuggets.

o	When unloaded, hold right click to load gunpowder. Let go after about 2 seconds (the sound effect is a good indicator)

o	When blank (gunpowder loaded), hold right click to load a lead nugget. Let go after about 2 seconds (the sound effect is a good indicator)

o	When loaded, right click to fire. Bronze firearms are pretty inaccurate.

o	Pistol damage: 7.5 hearts. Musket damage: 12.5 hearts.

•	Steel firearms (revolver/rifle) fire bullets.

o	When unloaded, hold right click to load a bullet. Let go after about 2 seconds (the sound effect is a good indicator)

o	When loaded, right click to fire. Steel firearms have accuracy and bullet velocity based on material (note that every steel firearm is more durable and more accurate than any bronze firearm):

o	Nickel/Carbon Steel: Low durability, average accuracy/velocity

o	Nickel/Cobalt Steel: High durability, low accuracy/velocity

o	Nickel/Titanium Steel: Average durability, high accuracy/velocity

o	Revolver damage: 7.5 hearts. Rifle damage: 20 hearts.

o	Revolvers can hold four bullets at once, and all four are loaded with one reload action.

•	Crafting Recipes

o	Bullet: (L is lead nugget, C is copper nugget, G is gunpowder) makes 2 bullets

     L
     
L   G   L

C   G   C

o	Gun Barrel: (M is metal ingot – any of the four firearm alloys)

MMM


MMM

o	Pistol/Revolver: (= is gun barrel, M is metal ingot same alloy as barrel, F is firestarter (for bronze) or flint and steel (for steel), W is planks, S is stick)

 F   =
 
M W

 S
 
o	Musket/Rifle: (same as pistol/revolver)

F   =   =

M W W

S

19. Creative mode

•	If you’re screwing around in creative mode, you may notice there are duplicates of some items (iron tools/armor, coal blocks, and so on). This is because the properties of vanilla items and blocks are impossible to change without using a coremod (horrible ASM code which tends to break things). It’s much easier (and “correct” from a coding perspective) to just make an identical mod variant of the block/item and then make the crafting recipe produce the mod variant instead of the vanilla variant.
